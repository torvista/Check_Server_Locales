# Check Server Locales for LC_TIME (for Zen Cart)
Parses arrays of common locale names, to check which are installed on a server (Windows/Unix) and so confirm what name you may use for LC_TIME in the two (storefont/admin) base Zen Cart language files.

The script is stand-alone/it does *not* need Zen Cart to execute: you can locate it anywhere, but probably the most appropriate location in a Zen Cart fileset would be ``/extras``.

If you want to add a check for your language, instructions are in the script.
